# Xmaps-System
Data Structures Project  (Self Effort)


Hi welcome to xmaps systems
this is a actually a c++ backend app made using standard template library containers and functions
key components used-
STL(  map,vector,string ,multiset)
Algorithm  Dijkstra's  shortest path


Practical implementation-  If an ambulance driver drives in a traffic jammed area he wants to reach hospital in time and a fair 
tradeoff can be done in shortest distance and shortest time

how to use - 
please use the test data one at a time  of the two given
and follow instructions

i have used traffic density to limit the speed of vehicle between different roads and provide you with a comparison of shortest
distance and shortest time
and if u follow shortest time how much extra fuel u need to spend not more than value of a human life :)
